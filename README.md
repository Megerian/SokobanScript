This is an implementation of the Sokoban game in Typescript.

It has been implemented to offer a way to play the Sokoban levels which are part of the Sokoban solver tests published at: https://sokoban-solver-statistics.sourceforge.io/statistics/OpenTestSuite/

You can try out the app at: https://sokoban-solver-statistics.sourceforge.io/

To run the app on your computer:

1. Download the coding (clone repository) or download the whole project as zip (https://github.com/Megerian/SokobanScript/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
3. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
4. In the project folder of the app run: npm install
5. Then run: npm install -g parcel
6. run: npm run start

This compiles the files and you should see the message: Server running at http://localhost:1234
Then you can open that URL in your browser.
